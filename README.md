# My Sample HR Dashboard

## Tasks

Try to complete as many of the required tasks as possible, they can be completed in any order:
* Create a new branch for your changes
* Create an API call to fetch the list of employees
* Display the list of employees and attributes
* Add a button to sort the employee list by names
* Create simple authentication hook that stores a tokenized value and then displays it as the current user
* Create a logout button
* Create additional tests for any components you created on the exercise

All these required tasks are defined with more details using inline `TODO` comments through the codebase.  These represent the stubs that should be filled out.

At the end of the exercise, submit your code to the new branch.
